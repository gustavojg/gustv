## Installation

Follow these steps to install the project dependencies and set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gustavojg/gustv.git
```
```sh
cd gustv
```

## Step 2: Start installation

```bash
# using npm
npm i

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```
```bash
# Pods installation
npx pod-install ios
```
```bash
# .env config
copy axample.env to .env
```


## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run start:android

# OR using Yarn
yarn start:android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run start:ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn start:ios
```

### For iOS Tablet

```bash
# using npm
npm run start:ios-tablet

# OR using Yarn
yarn start:ios-tablet
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
